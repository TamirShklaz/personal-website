        I love building products. I get incredible joy from going from idea to
        reality and seeing the tangible impact of what I build on peopleâ€™s
        lives. As a founder of three startups, Iâ€™ve been hands-on with every
        part of the processâ€”from user research and design to strategy, copy, and
        engineering.
      </p>
      <p>Thatâ€™s me on the professional side.</p>
      <p>
        Personally, Iâ€™m obsessed with growth and learning. Iâ€™m always asking
        myself how I can do something better and how to push the limits of my
        comfort zone. If Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll likely find me rock climbing,
        bachata dancing, or teaching yoga ðŸ§˜
      </p>
      <p>
        At my core, Iâ€™m driven by a mission to help others lead lives truly
        worth living. To me, a meaningful life comes down to three key pillars:
        <ol className={"mt-4"}>
          <li>1. Physical health and well-being</li>
          <li>2. Financial security and freedom</li>
          <li>3. A mindset thatâ€™s both content and joyful</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve dedicated my career to building impactful products in
        education and healthcare.
